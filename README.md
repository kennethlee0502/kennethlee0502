<h3 align="center">Fullstack Engineer from NYC üóΩ</h3>

# üí´ About Me:
Having spent a few years helping clients achieve their dream of owning a home, I've decided to pursue my passion for software development and start building dreams with code instead. Making the transition into software development has been the best decision I've ever made! I take immense satisfaction in creating new things and relish the challenge of constantly learning something new. I'm open to new technologies and I currently specialize as a full-stack developer with a focus on Javascript. I'm eager to explore new opportunities and look forward to discussing how my skills and passion can contribute to your team.
